# Pick System
The pick system is one used in most wearhouses. The pick system I used while working at Walton beverage is made by Vermont Information Processing.

This project was an attempt at recreating the system using excel as a database 

This system is using a excel file used in production by the company I worked for it has no personal or important information about anyone at any of the locations. The file contains one whole day of orders.

# Disclaimer
I did use Microsoft copilot to build and create this code. However I do ensure that all the code that I build is effective and I go through each line created by AI and I need to approve it to be used as my code. As such I do consider this whole project to Be my code that I had help to create. 

# Overview

The Program is a CML Program that only developers are able to use it is a starting point to learn C# and more about Classes.

As the program is currently it will read and print the needed information for a picker to go to a location in the wherehouse and get the requested product.

# Development Environment

I used Microsofts Visual Studio Code to run and debug the program. 

# Future Work

- write picker program (CML) for picker to go to location and pick product (using a order from each store)
- I will need to make a class for each store including their orders and how much product is needed probobly will use a dictionary in a store object.
- a GUI that could be used on a device such as a phone would be ideal but with it being a learning project I doubt I will get that far.
